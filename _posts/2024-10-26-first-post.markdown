# intro

recently i've been wanting to practice using pure functional languages. i thought leetcode would be great for that as i have used it in the past to practice problems in other languages. disappointingly, it doesn't support any true functional programming languages. so i created this blog to share my solutions using clojure.

i will also be blogging about my rock climbing and mountain biking adventures so please tune in.
